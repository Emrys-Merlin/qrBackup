qrBackup
========

This tool takes a text file and optionally a pgp key id and afterwards
encrypts the text. Then it generates QR-Codes of said encrypted text
and puts everything in a pdf for printing. This is meant as an easy
way to generate paper backups for your revoke certificate, private
keys or other text data, you would like to have a hard copy of.
